This module adds an action "Reversal" on account moves,
to allow the accountant to create reversal account moves in 2 clicks.
Also add on account entries:

* a checkbox and filter "to be reversed"
* a link between an entry and its reversal entry

Odoo v11c include a similar action (overwritten by this addon), but with less
features, for instance:

* Allowing inheritance
* Options like prefix (for journal entry and journal item), post and reconcile.
* Create a link between the entry and its reversal
* Mark entries to be reversed in the future.
